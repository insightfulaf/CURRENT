# VS Code Setup (Canonical Editor)

## One-time project settings

- `.vscode/settings.json` enforces:
  - UTF-8 encoding
  - LF line endings
  - Prettier as default formatter
  - Format on Save
- `.editorconfig` mirrors the same rules.
- `.gitattributes` treats images/PDFs/zips as binary (prevents corruption).

## Extensions to install

- **Prettier** (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- **Live Server** (ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Edit & Preview

- Open folder: `File → Open Folder… → ~/Dropbox/InsightfulAffiliate_NextGenCopyAI`
- Open `landing_pages/index.html` → click **Go Live** for instant preview.

## Safe editing rules

- Edit code only in VS Code (never Word/Pages/Docs).
- When pasting from web/docs, use _Paste and Match Style_ to avoid “smart quotes”.
- Keep assets in `assets/` and reference with relative paths.

## If the editor looks stale

- Dropbox usually syncs in seconds; when it says **Up to date**, VS Code should show the same.
- If needed:
  - Command Palette → **Developer: Reload Window**
  - Or close/reopen VS Code
  - Run `git status` in the terminal to see actual file changes
```
