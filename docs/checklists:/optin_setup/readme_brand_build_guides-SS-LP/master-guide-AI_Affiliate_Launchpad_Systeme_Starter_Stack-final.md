## Funnel templates and page copy

* **Opt‑in (Squeeze) page:** A hero section with a clear headline (“Unlock AI‑Powered Funnels in 60 Minutes”), a sub‑headline describing the free Starter Stack, three benefit‑oriented bullet points (done‑for‑you Systeme.io templates, 7 pre‑written emails, and a 60‑minute quickstart checklist) and a prominent call‑to‑action button (“Get the Free Starter Stack”). There is also a concise disclosure that you may earn a commission[activecampaign.com](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/opt-in-copy#:~:text=Be%20clear,most%20important%20thing%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20clarity).

* **Thank‑you page:** A headline (“You’re In—Let’s Build Your Funnel Today”), two buttons (primary button linking back to Systeme.io for the 1‑Hour Build; secondary button promoting KoalaWriter with the INSIGHTFUL15 coupon), and a small note reminding buyers about the 15% discount. Micro‑steps are provided: check your email for the download and checklist, import the templates into Systeme.io, draft short content in Rytr, and publish your first post.

* **Optional link‑hub page (/go):** A lightweight page with three buttons (Start the Free Stack, Try Rytr, Try KoalaWriter) using your unified button styles. This “bio‑link” centralises your social‑media traffic and allows you to change affiliate destinations without editing every post.

## 7‑email sequence (Launchpad campaign)

1. **Deliver \+ Momentum:** Sends the download link and encourages the user to follow the 60‑minute build video; emphasises that you use these tools yourself and may earn a commission.

2. **Remove Friction:** Lists the top three problems beginners face (blank pages, tech overwhelm, no follow‑up) and directs them back to Systeme.io to import the templates.

3. **Proof of Progress:** Provides a 24‑hour checklist: publish the opt‑in page, connect the form to the campaign, add the thank‑you button, send a test email, and reply “DONE” to receive a bonus checklist.

4. **List Growth \+ Rytr Intro:** Explains how a single prompt can become a blog post, email and short video; suggests trying Rytr for quick drafts and links to your Rytr affiliate.

5. **Mini Caselet:** Shares a short before/after story (blank funnel → imported templates \+ a blog \+ one short) that netted 20 subscribers and 2 trial sign‑ups within 48 hours; invites readers to duplicate the steps.

6. **Objection Sweep:** Addresses the “I’m not a tech person” objection by reminding readers that templates mean they only need to edit copy and publish; links back to the funnel setup.

7. **Recap \+ Next Step:** Provides a 7‑day calendar (publish, blog, email, short, check stats, rest/batch) and introduces KoalaWriter for long‑form content, with the 15% off coupon.

## Checklists and quickstarts

* **60‑minute quickstart:** Step‑by‑step video and checklist for importing the templates into a new Systeme.io account, copying the opt‑in page, connecting the email sequence, and publishing.

* **24‑hour checklist:** A high‑level summary delivered in email \#3 that ensures the user publishes the opt‑in page, connects the campaign, sets up the thank‑you button, and sends a test email within the first day.

* **7‑day plan (email \#7):** Lays out what to do each day of the first week—publish, post a blog, send an email, record a short video, check stats, then rest and batch content.

## Compliance and disclosures

* Each page and email includes a one‑line disclosure clarifying that you may earn a commission when readers purchase via your links[activecampaign.com](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/opt-in-copy#:~:text=Be%20clear,most%20important%20thing%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20clarity). This is consistent with FTC guidelines and emphasises transparency.

## Additional assets delivered

* **HTML blocks:** The hero and thank‑you sections are provided as copy‑paste HTML (stored as hero\_block.html and thank\_you\_block.html) that call your affiliate links and use unified styling.

* **Unified CSS & manifest:** A single CSS file (ngcai.css) defines all button styles, gradients, dark/light themes, and layout utilities. The updated web manifest holds your brand name and icons.

* **Head snippet:** A template to insert into Systeme’s “Edit header code” section, with placeholders for page title, description, canonical URL, favicon, and social images.

* **Affiliate mapping & asset tracker:** JSON files and Markdown tables document your deep links (Systeme.io, Rytr, Koala), coupon codes, and asset URLs to ensure consistent wiring across pages and emails.

* **Blog & FAQ files:** Two blog post drafts (“Rytr vs KoalaWriter” and “Best Budget AI Writers 2025”) with FAQ JSON‑LD blocks and suggested banner text for Canva; these support the Launchpad content and feed traffic into your funnel.

* **Link‑hub code:** A ready‑to‑paste HTML snippet for /go with three buttons using your unified button classes.

## Personal recommendation

* After reviewing all conversation threads and files, I confirm that the AI Affiliate Launchpad/Starter Stack now includes all core components promised in your meta description: plug‑and‑play funnel templates, 7 email scripts, and a 60‑minute quickstart checklist, all tailored to beginners. If you haven’t already, upload your favicons, OG images, and CSS to Systeme’s media library and replace the placeholders in the head snippet with the resulting URLs for a fully working setup. The optional link‑in‑bio page will streamline social‑media traffic and make it easy to swap affiliate programs later.
