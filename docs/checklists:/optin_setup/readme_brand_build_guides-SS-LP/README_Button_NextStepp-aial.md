## Make it look exactly like the original
- Select the PAGE in the Systeme editor → set **Background color** to `#0B0B12`.
- Select the **Section** that holds the Custom HTML → set **Padding (top/bottom)** to `0` and **Background** to **transparent**.
- If your theme constrains width, set the Section’s **Content width** to **Full width** (or 100%).

Tip: `html/ia-hero--no-form.html` also sets `html, body { background:#0B0B12; }` in case you prefer code-only.
