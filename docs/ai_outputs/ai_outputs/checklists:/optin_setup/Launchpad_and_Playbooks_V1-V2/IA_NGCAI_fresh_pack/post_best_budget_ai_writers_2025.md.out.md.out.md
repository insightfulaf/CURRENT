## 3) Free Option: Prompts + Docs
- Tools: Google Docs (or Notion) + your preferred LLM for ideas + Grammarly for editing.
- Upgrade path: Start with Rytr for faster emails/scripts, then add KoalaWriter for publishable content.

## Beginner Roadmap (Week 1)
1. Publish a lead magnet page (use my starter stack).
2. Send a welcome email (see Rytr prompt below).
3. Publish one long-form post (KoalaWriter draft + your edits).
4. Record a 20-second short promoting the lead magnet.

## Copy-Paste Prompts
- **Welcome Email (Rytr):** “Write a 160–200 word welcome email that delivers [lead magnet], sets a 60-minute quickstart, and teases a checklist for tomorrow.”
- **Hooks (Rytr):** “Give me 10 short hooks (<=12 words) for a beginner trying to [result]. Avoid hype; focus on relief and speed.”
