```

### GitHub Web UI Verification
1. Go to: https://github.com/insightfulaf/CURRENT
2. Verify branch `copilot/request-pr-review` is deleted
3. Check that the documentation files appear in the main branch file list
4. Verify PR #2 shows as "Merged" (purple badge)

- ✅ PR #2 will be marked as "Merged" and closed
- ✅ Branch `copilot/request-pr-review` will be deleted
- ✅ Documentation will be available in main branch
- ✅ All commits (4 total) will be preserved in git history

## Alternative: Close Without Merging

If you decide NOT to keep the documentation:

### Using GitHub CLI
```bash
gh pr close 2
```

### Using GitHub Web UI
1. Go to: https://github.com/insightfulaf/CURRENT/pull/2
2. Click "Close pull request" button at the bottom
3. Optionally delete the branch

**Note**: This will NOT add the documentation to main, but PR #1's merge is already complete, so the original task is done either way.

1. Documentation is well-organized and comprehensive
2. Can serve as a reference for future PR workflows
3. Shows how to work within AI agent constraints

5. Total size is small (~15K)
6. Can be useful for onboarding or process documentation

## Quick Reference Commands

gh pr merge 2 --merge --delete-branch

# Option B: Merge with git (more control)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git merge origin/copilot/request-pr-review --no-ff
git push origin main
git push origin --delete copilot/request-pr-review

# Option C: Close without merging
gh pr close 2
```
